# README

Xponent is my Flatiron Mod 3 Ruby on Rails Project.

It is a team application with the simple goal of being able to do more - together. (Xponent- to the nth power)

- Assign tasks to team members, or work a task
- Stay connected with an asynchronous message board function
- See who's working, and what they are working on
- Who needs help, how to add the power of Xponent to exceed customer Xpectations!
